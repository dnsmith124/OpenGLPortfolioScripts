# C# Scripts for an OpenGL Diablo-style ARPG

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. My portfolio site has a normal, flat site for browsing examples of my work, but also will feature an interactive version that takes the form of a short action roleplaying game in the style of Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo. These scripts run the features of that game.
